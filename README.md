# ChromeDinoEvolved (Discontinued)
I'm building a game which is like the old Google Chrome Dinosaur game which you used to get when you had no internet connection, but give it a better texture and maybe better gameplay. Google and I are not associated at all and the game idea belongs to Google.

I'd like to say this has been discontinued.
